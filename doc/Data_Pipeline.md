## Data Pipeline Presentation

*We have not been able to evaluate the actual data we will be working with since our sponsor is working on anonymizing the datasets. However, we have been working with the public version of electricity consumption data from New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) which will be similar in format to the actual data.

### Describe and quantify the available data

The raw data file from NYCHA includes monthly electricity consumption and cost data for buildings in New York City from January 2010 to June 2018. The complete dataset has 313147 rows and 27 columns. 

There are 13 variables used to identify building information:

### Address issues with the incoming data

* scaling, missing value imputation, erroneous data point:

1. General Data Cleaning

We cleaned the raw data to exclude rows with null account name and estimated electricity charges since they will not have accurate predictive value for our model.

We also cleaned data types of consumption and cost data from string to float so that we can generate distribution statistics from 

2. Create Unique identifier



3. Address Date inconsistency
Since the meter reading is done manually in many buildings in New York, the meter reading dates (service start date and service end date) are not consistent across all entries. However, the reading dates can be used to identify overlaps in billing period to detect overcharging due to double billing. 

* Challenges in data pipeline creation:

### Provide some additional insight to the data in the form of statistical or graphical analysis.

### Fully describe which features you will be using in your design
